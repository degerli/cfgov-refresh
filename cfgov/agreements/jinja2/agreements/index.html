            <h1>Credit card agreement database</h1>

            <p>
                The CFPB maintains a database
                of credit card agreements from hundreds of card issuers.
                Using the tool below,
                you can search for an agreement by the name of the issuer.
            </p>

            <h5>Show agreements by card issuer</h5>

            {{ issuer_select() }}

            {% include '_search_helper.html' %}

            <p>
                This search method accesses all credit card agreements as of the CFPBâ€™s most recent quarterly collection of
                credit card agreements. To access all agreements from the most recent or earlier periods, please click on the
                relevant agreement link below. (Please note that the Bureau did not collect agreements for 2015. The January
                2016 archive is a sample that was collected by Bureau staff from the publicly-available websites of the largest
                credit card issuers as of the first week of January 2016, and does not constitute a full set of agreements).
                Credit card issuers are generally required to post the credit card agreements that they offer to the public on
                their websites, with limited exceptions.
                If you are an issuer, email <a href="mailto:CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov">CardAgreements@consumerfinance.gov</a>
                for agreement submission instructions.
            </p>

                The CARD Act is often called the Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights.
                President Obama signed the bill into law in May 2009. Many of the most
                significant provisions of the law took effect in February 2010.
